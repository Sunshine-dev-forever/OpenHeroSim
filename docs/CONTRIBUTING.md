### Development environment setup
For all:
Create a GODOT environment variable that points at the Godot executable

#### VS Code

get exensions:
	required:
		EditorConfig for VS code

	suggested:
		Godot Tools	
		C#
		C# Dev Kit
		IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit
		Any Nuget Package Manager

Download the Nuget packages listed in the csproj (they might be installed automatically)

#### Visual Studio
TODO

### Code Style
[CODE_STYLE](CODE_STYLE.md)

### Guidelines
General Guiding Principles:
	We want to keep C# and Godot seperated as much as possible, that means:
		C# classes should never if possible inhert from Godot Nodes
		Godot functions should be avoided

### Accepted contributions
Any contributions will be accepted as long as they follow the code style, code guidelines, and dont directly contradict the [project goals](PROJECT_GOALS.md).

And when I mean directly contridict, I mean *very* directly contradict.
Want to add rideable animals? allowed.
Want to add other dimensions? allowed.
Want to add weather? allowed
Want to transform the game into a first-person muliplayer shooter? Maybe go somewhere else for that one.

There are some features that would need justification:
Stealth mechanics. -- this is an all AI game. AI is bad at detecting stealth and bad at using it. I cant think of a way to make this work, does not meant that it is impossible though


### Additional help
I certainly understand that this project does not have perfect documentation, if you want any help please join the development discord here https://discord.gg/RcvAtQj268 and message me (Sunshine dev) directly
