# CODE_STYLE

everything is handled by the .editorconfig file. If something is not handled by the .editorconfig file, then submit a PR to make the issue handled by the .editorconfig.

If there is something that .editorconfig cannot enforce, then add it here:
- right now there is nothing.

### File and Folder names:
Directory names should begin with an uppercase letter. Except under the Game/Scenes folder which will follow the snake_case naming scheme. If anyone thinks this is stupid feel free to discuss it. I'm not very picky about code style.
